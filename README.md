# CapsLockTreatment
Use with keyboards that do not indicate whether CapsLock and NumLock are on.

I once bought a Philips wireless keyboard that had no indication of when the CapsLock option was on. So I developed a small program using Lazarus/FreePascal that creates a form with 2 TEdit that indicates whether the CapsLock and the NumLock key are on or off.
