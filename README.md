# CapsLockTreatment
Use with keyboards that do not indicate whether CapsLock is on

I once bought a Philips wireless keyboard that had no indication of when the CapsLock option was on. So I developed a small program using Lazarus/FreePascal that creates a form with a TEdit that indicates whether the CapsLock key is on or off. The button appears glued to the left of the Windows taskbar. It is designed for use with a 32-inch television.
